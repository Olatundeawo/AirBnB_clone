AirBnB clone - The console
Description:
First step: Write a command interpreter to manage your AirBnB objects.
This is the first step towards building your first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because you will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration…

Each task is linked and will help you to:

put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances
create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Place…) that inherit from BaseModel
create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine

The console

=> create your data model
=> manage (create, update, destroy, etc) objects via a console / command interpreter
=> store and persist objects to a file (JSON file) The first piece is to manipulate a powerful storage system. This storage engine will give us an abstraction between “My object” and “How they are stored and persisted”. This means: from your console code (the command interpreter itself) and from the front-end and RestAPI you will build later, you won’t have to pay attention (take care) of how your objects are stored. This abstraction will also allow you to change the type of storage easily without updating all of your codebase. The console will be a tool to validate this storage engine

Command interpreter

Our command interpreter looks like a mini shell and allow us manage the objects of our project:

Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
Update attributes of an object
Destroy an object
